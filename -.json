Thanks much!\n- Reply Tweet: There's a bunch of cool ones on here: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-image-generators\n\n### Tweet #2\n- Initial Tweet: is there a AI tool that can help create comic book stories based on prompts and a story line\n- Reply Tweet: several on here! https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-comic-generators\n\n### Tweet #3\n- Initial Tweet: Sir, is there an AI tool that is able to create a short video based on an image? I want to create a short commercial video but I only have some photos of the product.\n- Reply Tweet: I think some of these allow you to include images w/ your prompt: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-text-to-video-tools\n\n### Tweet #4\n- Initial Tweet: Are there AI tools that can give you a professional design for an entire web app UI?\n- Reply Tweet: We have a really good list here! https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-design-tools\n\n---\nHere's some feedback on tweets you previously wrote that you should consider for this tweet you are writing. Please reivew this feedback and apply my suggestions when you are writing this tweet:\n\n### Feedback 1\n\n- Input Tweet: I hate video tutorials so fucking much is there an AI tool that give me text ones from a video\n- Your Output: These tools can convert videos into text formats: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-video-to-blog-tools\n\nInstead of what you wrote, I would write this instead: \"Some of these tools may help: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-video-to-blog-tools\"\n\n### Feedback 2\n\n- Input Tweet: Is there an AI tool that takes design instructions and produces high fidelity designs?\n- Your Output: Great design tools listed here: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-design-tools\n\nInstead of what you wrote, I suggest you respond more like this: \"There's some great AI design tools on here: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-design-tools\"\n\n### Feedback 3\n\n- Input Tweet: This is sick! How do you actually get the design? Are there any ai tools that help with designing that we can then port to cursor?\n- Your Output: There are several AI design tools that might help with what you need: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-design-tools\n\nInstead of what you wrote, I suggest you respond more like this: \"There are some design tools that may help here: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-design-tools\"\n\n### Feedback 4\n\n- Input Tweet: is there an ai tool out there where i can just talk to it and it summarizes what i say? hahahahaa like i gotta stop calling @tasonjorres and brain dump\n- Your Output: These AI meeting note takers could help with those brain dumps: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-meeting-note-takers\n\nInstead of what you wrote, I suggest you respond more like this: \"These could help out with those brain dumps: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-meeting-note-takers\". It is okay to exclude the exact category name in your response to keep it short.\n\n### Feedback 4\n\n- Input Tweet: are there any AI tools that timestamp youtube videos for you?\n- Your Output: You'll find some helpful tools here: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-video-to-blog-tools\n\nInstead of what you wrote, I suggest you respond more like this: \"Some of these may be helpful: https://aitools.inc/categories/ai-video-to-blog-tools\". Since the category we are sharing isn't an exact match to what they are asking, we should with a little less certainty.\n\n---\nTweet you will be replying to:\n{{ $node['get_tweet_content'].json.tweet_content }}\n\n---\nList of category page urls on our AI Tools directory.
